<details>
  <summary>This tab contains spoilers from the theme and original game. These will only show up when Safe Mode is turned off.</summary>
  
  The following themes are shown, if not mentioned, in this theme: Depression, Suicide, Self-Harm, Abuse. Other uncomfortable things, such as jumpscares or suggestive poems, may also appear as well. To go into heavy detail, here's what you may run into via random chances:
  
  • Sayori hanging when PayMode is activated on gameplay screen. (Art by UsagiSii)
  
  • Red vision appearing during gameplay screen. (1/30th chance)
  
  • A doodle drawing of Sayori hanging with the caption "Now everyone can be happy" on secret poems screen. (1/10th chance)

  • Some poems may have suicical or realistically descriptive subjects as mentioned above.

  • Ghost Menu triggers randomly when going to the title menu, this screen is not playable and will close your game if any input is detected. (1/64th chance)

  • If you are caught, the music selection will turn into a ghost book. There is no changing this back unless you debug the theme, DO NOT GET CAUGHT. (1/100th chance)

  • Holding Shift and pressing PrintScreen to take a screenshot on certain poems may show secret messages that can be startling.

  • If you see a poem that says "TURN BACK IMMEDIATELY", you are caught and a loud jumpscare will play before the poem kicks you out of the screen. (1/100th chance)

  • A special poem, specifically a threat note, will appear. A laugh will play before kicking you out of the screen. (1/10th chance)
  
  • The "Her" series of poems mentions NSFW themes, including sexual intercourse.

# WARNING: This theme may have problems outside of dance and pump mode.

You can join the [Sushiverse Entertainment Discord](https://discord.gg/Sa7XMWp) if you want to contact me regarding the theme in #dokidokirevolution, I'm also on r/DDLC and Doki Doki Modding Club if you want to reach out to me there instead.

# Special Thanks

Inorizushi for the DDR WORLD gameplay background code.
Jose_Varela for helping me with the interactive hearts background for gameplay.
Rhythm Lunatic for the Difficulty Select code.
Everyone who enjoyed this project.

# Next Plan?

Maybe push a new fork that removes the DDLC characters, this theme has potential to be something without the *Doki Doki Literature Club* cast.
Whether or not I keep this DDLC version up forever is a mystery...
