# 2024 Update
WE'RE BACK, BACK AGAIN!!! LFG!!!!
Tons of new updates coming to this theme, including more QoL changes for competitive play. Hopefully new character art assets will come into play as well as backgrounds. This theme is constantly updated so be wary that new features and bugs will be added as the updates go by.

***WARNING: This theme may have problems outside of dance and pump mode.***

You can join the [Sushiverse Entertainment Discord](https://discord.gg/Sa7XMWp) if you want to contact me regarding the theme in #dokidokirevolution, I'm also on r/DDLC and Doki Doki Modding Club if you want to reach out to me there instead.
