# 2024 Update
WE'RE BACK, BACK AGAIN!!! LFG!!!!
Tons of new updates coming to this theme, including more QoL changes for competitive play. Hopefully new character art assets will come into play as well as backgrounds. This theme is constantly updated so be wary that new features and bugs will be added as the updates go by.

  The following themes are shown, if not mentioned, in this theme: Depression, Suicide, Self-Harm, Abuse. Other uncomfortable things, such as jumpscares or suggestive poems, may also appear as well. To go into heavy detail, here's what you may run into via random chances:

  • Red vision appearing during gameplay screen. (1/30th chance)
  
  • A doodle drawing of Sayori hanging with the caption "Now everyone can be happy" on secret poems screen. (1/10th chance)

  • Some poems may have suicical or realistically descriptive subjects as mentioned above.

  • Ghost Menu triggers randomly when going to the title menu, this screen is not playable and will close your game if any input is detected. (1/64th chance)

  • If you are caught, the music selection will turn into a ghost book. There is no changing this back unless you debug the theme, DO NOT GET CAUGHT. (1/100th chance)

  • Holding Shift and pressing PrintScreen to take a screenshot on certain poems may show secret messages that can be startling.

  • If you see a poem that says "TURN BACK IMMEDIATELY", you are caught and a loud jumpscare will play before the poem kicks you out of the screen. (1/100th chance)

  • A special poem, specifically a threat note, will appear. A laugh will play before kicking you out of the screen. (1/10th chance)
  
  • The "Her" series of poems mentions NSFW themes, including sexual intercourse.
